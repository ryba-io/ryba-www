# Tutorial
 // To Do Writing a Middle

##  Architecture

Ryba installs hadoop on each server component by component
The list and configuration for each server's components is placed in the ryba-cluster/conf/servers.coffee file.
Each module installed has its sources placed in the ryba root directory.
how does it work ?

Your can add the middleware you want to execute in the previous servers.coffee file/
Your module has to come as a directory that you will place inside the ryba directory.
For exemple if you want to install a module name myNewModule you will have to place a directory containg the sources
name 'myNewModule' and place it in ryba directory.
The result will be /ryba/boostrap
           /ryba/hadoop
           /ryba/hbase
           /ryba/myNewModule

Of course you can then divide your module in sub parts.

##  Needed files
You have to specify which script ryba will execute in a file named after your component.
Your file has to have the extension **.coffee.md**
So for our example the directory tree will be ryba
          /ryba/boostrap/...
          /ryba/boostrap/...
          ...
          /ryba/myNewModule/myNewModule.coffee.md          

Ryba will read it ( by default ) and see which script to execute for the different commands 

The different commands are : - install
               - start
               - stop
               - check
               - status
 For example if you have a script myNewModule_check.coffee.md which checks if the installation of your component is correct
 You have to export it in the module as 'check'  

   ```
   module.exports.push commands: 'check', modules: 'ryba/myNewModule/myNewModule_check.coffee'
   ```
 It works the same way if you want to execute several script for one command

    ```
    module.exports.push commands: 'install', modules: [
      'ryba/myNewModule/myNewModule_install.coffee'
      'ryba/myNewModule/myNewModule_check.coffee'
    ]
    ```
