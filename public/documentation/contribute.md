# Getting Started for contributors

Contributors are mostly involved with Ryba, Masson and Mecano. Those three
projects are tightly coupled and are developed conjointly. Instructions include
how to download the source code of each project and how to wire them from
your own project (eg "ryba-cluster").

## Preparation

Git, Node.js and NPM must be correctly installed on your host. This page assumes you have
read and understand the [Getting Started][gs] instructions wich introduce and setup a
testing environment.

This example install each package inside the same "ryba" package present in your
home directory. You could should to place each package in any location. We use
the NPM command "link" wich take care of declaring your local git repositories
instead of seing them as external dependencies.

```bash
mkdir ~/ryba
cd ~/ryba
```

## Mecano

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adaltas/node-mecano mecano
cd mecano
npm link
```

## Masson

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adaltas/node-masson masson
cd masson
npm link
```

## Ryba

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryba-io/ryba
cd ryba
npm link
```

## Ryba Cluster

[ryba-cluster](http://github.com/ryba-io/ryba.git) is the preconfigured
installation of ryba with 6 nodes. It targets a development host with 16GB of
memory and 6 virtual machines managed with Vagrant.

```
git clone https://github.com/ryba-io/ryba-cluster
cd ryba-cluster
npm install
```

Note, OSX users might enjoy using the "Console" application to graphically tail
the logs generated by Ryba. Here how we do it:

```
brew install hardlink-osx
mkdir -p /Users/wdavidw/Library/Logs/__ryba-cluster
rm -r log
hln /Users/wdavidw/Library/Logs/__ryba-cluster log
open /Applications/Utilities/Console.app
```
